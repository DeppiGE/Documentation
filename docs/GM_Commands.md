# GM Commands

The commands you use may vary depending on the file set you're working with. To execute these commands, you can utilize the chat window within the game.

You have the option to modify the minimum admin level requirements through the ```AdminLvSet.shn``` file. However, if your desired set does not support this SHN file, you will have to edit the Zone.exe file using a debugger. Below I will provide an example of how to achieve this using the ```&makeitem``` GM command. For the purpose of this example, I will be using the TW2008 file set.

```bash
push 64
mov dword ptr ds:[ebx+8],edx
push 0x50DF20 | "&makeitem"
```

Please pay attention to the ```push 64``` mentioned above. By converting 64 (Hexadecimal) to Decimal, we find that it equals 100. Therefore, this represents our admin level. Now, let's assume you want this command to only require an admin level of 10, in which case we would change it to ```A```. Consequently, your final modification would resemble the following:

```bash
push 0xA
mov dword ptr ds:[ebx+8],edx
push 0x50DF20 | "&makeitem"
```
